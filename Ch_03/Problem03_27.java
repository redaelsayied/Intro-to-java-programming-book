/**
 (Geometry: points in triangle?) Suppose a right triangle is placed in a plane as
 shown below. The right-angle point is placed at (0, 0), and the other two points
 are placed at (200, 0) and (0, 100). Write a program that prompts the user to enter
 a point with x- and y-coordinates and determines whether the point is inside the
 triangle. Here are the sample runs:
 Enter a point’s x- and y-coordinates: 100.5 25.5
 The point is in the triangle
