 * 2.12 (Physics: finding runway length) Given an airplaneâ€™s acceleration a and take-off
 * speed v, you can compute the minimum runway length needed for an airplane to
 * take off using the following formula:
 * length = v2
 * 2a
 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter v in meters/second (m/s) and
 * the acceleration a in meters/second squared (m/s
 * 2
 * ), then, displays the minimum
 * runway length.
 * Enter speed and acceleration: 60 3.5
 * The minimum runway length for this airplane is 514.286
